## ✨ Overview

**Smart Environmental Sentinel** is a cutting-edge Arduino-based system designed to intelligently monitor environmental conditions by fusing data from gas, temperature, and humidity sensors. This prototype employs **context-aware logic** to detect hazards and initiate state-driven responses using LED and audio feedback.

Rather than just threshold detection, this system applies **adaptive logic layers** that analyze gas levels and climate conditions together  mimicking real-time cognition.

> ⚡ Ideal for smart home security, indoor air quality monitoring, and embedded AI experiments.

## 🔍 Features

- 🔬 **Dual-Sensor Integration**
  
  Combines MQ2 gas sensor and DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor for broader awareness.

- 🧠 **Intelligent State Classification**
 
  Conditions are logically categorized as:
  - `NORMAL` – Green LED (🟢)
  - `ALERT` – Red LED pulsing (🔴)
  - `CRITICAL` – Red LED + Continuous buzzer (🚨)

- 🎯 **Multi-Layer Decision Engine**
   
  Adjusts response based on:
  - Gas concentration thresholds
  - Rapid temperature shifts
  - Humidity deviations

- 🔔 **Dynamic Feedback System**
  
  Audio-visual feedback changes in real-time based on severity.
